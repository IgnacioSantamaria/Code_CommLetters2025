Abstract. In this letter, we derive an expression for the achievable rate in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system assisted by a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) when the channels to and from the BD-RIS are line-of-sight (LoS) while the direct link is non-line-of-sight (NLoS). The rate expression allows to derive the optimal unitary and symmetric scattering BD-RIS matrix in closed form. Our simulation results show that the proposed solution is competitive even under the more usual Ricean channel fading model when the direct link is weak.
